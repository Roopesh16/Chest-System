# CHEST RUMBLE
A 'Clash of Clan' chest system replica, where we generate 4 random chest types and collect gems and coins

## Goal
The primary goal for me in this project was  - 
1. Implement Design patterns
2. Spawn Chest randomly
3. Add timer feature
4. Collect gems and coins once completed

Looking at the folder structure you can see the order in which I have arranged scripts. The whole idea was make codebase modular and easy to use.

## Rules
Click on **Generate** Button to generate random buttons


## Conclusion
This was a extensive learning project, where I got to implement 3 design pattern simultaneously and learn and how to manage code base and establish script communication.
